# cazycarve

Name might change to "carbme" or "SKÆRSGUMINEKULHYDRATAKTIVEENZYMER"

## Development 

### Prototype roadmap

  - [ ] Carl: Identify cazymes using the most comprehensible database (dbcan) and fastest aligner (diamond).
  - [ ] Ove: Link known substrates to state of the art genome scale metabolic models applying gap-filling etc.
  - [ ] Both: Integrate these two things together to estimate the growth potential of the identified cazyme-substrate links.

If the prototype is successful, we'll publish the pipeline as a CLI tool on bioconda for everyone to enjoy.

### Tool development roadmap
  - [ ] Test on many datasets and benchmark.
  - [ ] Write communication and publish in fancy journal.
  - [ ] Streamline package and publish on bioconda.
  - [ ] Win prizes and give talks at ISME.
