# Cazycarve

Name might change

## Prototype roadmap

  - [ ] Identify cazymes using the most comprehensible database (dbcan) and fastest aligner (diamond).
  - [ ] Link known substrates to state of the art genome scale metabolic models applying gap-filling etc.
  - [ ] Integrate these two things together to estimate the growth potential of the identified cazyme-substrate links.

## Tool development roadmap
  - [ ] Test on many datasets
  - [ ] Benchmark
  - [ ] Write short communication and publish in journal+bioconda
  - [ ] Win prizes and give talks at ISME.
